Now a municipal, provincial, and national historic site, the Old Burying Ground is a green space in downtown Halifax, where residents and tourists stroll and access the city\u2019s history via what Anne\u2019s friend calls \u201cthe queerest old tombstones, with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe graveyard is a refuge from the alienation of a first day of university where Anne is \u201csurrounded by crowds of strangers\u201d and \u201cfeel[s] insignificant.\u201d Anne follows Montgomery\u2019s own steps to Dalhousie or Redmond), and Anne, as the first woman from her rural hometown of Avonlea to go to university, repeatedly second guesses herself during this pioneering endeavour. After all, at the turn of the twentieth century, small-town Canadian women are supposed to get married, not go to university.\r\n\r\nAs anyone who grew up reading or watching Anne of Green Gables knows, nature is a significant source of delight and comfort for Anne. From the blooming cheery tree outside her Green Gables window to the lake of shining waters and the haunted woods to rural Prince Edward Island as a whole, Anne has a deep, Romantic bond with the natural world. And the Old Burying Ground is Anne\u2019s green oasis in the middle of the city (indeed, the graveyard has \u201cbusy, bustling, modern thoroughfares\u201d on two sides) and as Anne says, the burying ground is the only \u201cget-at-able place\u201d with trees within striking distance of the university and her urban lodgings.\r\n\r\nWhile Anne had doubts about a graveyard\u2019s potential to \u201ccheer\u201d her up, nature\u2019s positive impact on her, even in this new, alien urban context, remains. Nature is home for Anne; these Halifax trees are imagined as \u201cthe Avonlea woods,\u201d and during this initial excursion to the graveyard, Anne and her friend Priscilla meet a new friend and future roommate, Phillipa. By the end of the walk, Anne can declare, \u201cI'm glad we met her, and I'm glad we went to Old St. John's. I believe I've put forth a tiny soul-root into Kingsport soil this afternoon. I hope so.

While Anne didn\u2019t think that a graveyard could be \u201ccheering,\u201d its trees with their connotations of home and the fortuitous meeting of a new friend makes it so.\r\n\r\nThe Old Burying Ground is also a space of physical well-being (Priscilla describes going \u201call through it \u2026 for a pleasure exertion\u201d). It is also a potentially intellectually stimulating space: it a space of study (as Priscilla says, \u201cYou'll go there to study, Anne, see if you don't\u201d), and a space that is itself a history lesson.\r\n\r\nAnne and her friends highlight a bottom-up history of the Old Burying Ground by pointing out the tombstones of someone\u2019s \u201cfavourite child\u201d, a servant, and a \u201cmiddy\u201d (or midshipman), a junior-ranking officer. Montgomery emphasizes many of the tombstones\u2019 modesty\u2014most are \u201croughly chiselled brown or gray native stone.\u201d This emphasis on earlier, modest Haligionians connects to Anne\u2019s own modest background as a \u201cpoor\u201d \u201ccountry girl\u201d moving to the city and going to university, despite financial constraints and social pressure. Earlier that day at university registration, Anne felt \u201cinsignificant\u201d and states, I \u201cknew I would go down to my grave unwept, unhonored and unsung.\u201d Anne honours the young \u201cmiddy\u201d by dropping her corsage of flowers on his grave.

Green spaces in this novel\u2014initially the Old Burying Ground, later the garden of their rented house, and then Point Pleasant Park\u2014are central to these young women\u2019s academic success, supporting their all-round physical, intellectual, and emotional well-being.

                    "text": "In <i>Anne of the Island<\/i>, the third novel in the iconic Anne of Green Gables series, the irrepressible, red-haired heroine goes to Redmond University (Dalhousie in \u201creal life\u201d), which is located in Kingsport (a fictional version of Halifax, Nova Scotia).<br \/>Anne describes the Old St. John\u2019s graveyard (actually St. Paul\u2019s graveyard, also known as the Old Burying Ground), which was opened in 1749, the same year Halifax was established. 12,000 people from all walks of life and various religious denominations were buried here before it was closed to burials in 1844. Now a municipal, provincial, and national historic site, the Old Burying Ground is a green space in downtown Halifax, where residents and tourists stroll and access the city\u2019s history via what Anne\u2019s friend calls <q>the queerest old tombstones, with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions.<\/q> <br \/>The graveyard is a refuge from the alienation of a first day of university where Anne is<q>surrounded by crowds of strangers<\/q> and <q>feel[s] insignificant.<\/q> Anne follows Montgomery\u2019s own steps to Dalhousie or Redmond), and Anne, as the first woman from her rural hometown of Avonlea to go to university, repeatedly second guesses herself during this pioneering endeavour. After all, at the turn of the twentieth century, small-town Canadian women are supposed to get married, not go to university.<br \/>As anyone who grew up reading or watching Anne of Green Gables knows, nature is a significant source of delight and comfort for Anne. From the blooming cheery tree outside her Green Gables window to the lake of shining waters and the haunted woods to rural Prince Edward Island as a whole, Anne has a deep, Romantic bond with the natural world. And the Old Burying Ground is Anne\u2019s green oasis in the middle of the city (indeed, the graveyard has <q>busy, bustling, modern thoroughfares<\/q> on two sides) and as Anne says, the burying ground is the only <q>get-at-able place<\/q> with trees within striking distance of the university and her urban lodgings.<br \/>While Anne had doubts about a graveyard\u2019s potential to <q>cheer<\/q> her up, nature\u2019s positive impact on her, even in this new, alien urban context, remains. Nature is home for Anne; these Halifax trees are imagined as \u201cthe Avonlea woods,\u201d and during this initial excursion to the graveyard, Anne and her friend Priscilla meet a new friend and future roommate, Phillipa. By the end of the walk, Anne can declare, \u201cI'm glad we met her, and I'm glad we went to Old St. John's. I believe I've put forth a tiny soul-root into Kingsport soil this afternoon. I hope so. I hate to feel transplanted.\u201d This green space then helps create a sense of home and connection to place. While Anne didn\u2019t think thata graveyard could be \u201ccheering,\u201d its trees with their connotations of home and the fortuitous meeting of a new friend makes it so.<br \/>The Old Burying Ground is also a space of physical well-being (Priscilla describes going <q>all through it \u2026 for a pleasure exertion<\/q>). It is also a potentially intellectually stimulating space: it a space of study (as Priscilla says, <q>You'll go there to study, Anne, see if you don't<\/q>), and a space that is itself a history lesson.<br \/>Anne and her friends highlight a bottom-up history of the Old Burying Ground by pointing out the tombstones of someone\u2019s <q>favourite child,<\/q> a servant, and a <q>middy<\/q> (or midshipman), a junior-ranking officer. Montgomery emphasizes many of the tombstones\u2019 modesty\u2014most are <q>roughly chiselled brown or gray native stone.<\/q> This emphasis on earlier, modest Haligionians connects to Anne\u2019s own modest background as a <q>poor<\/q> <q>country girl<\/q> moving to the city and going to university, despite financial constraints and social pressure. Earlier that day at university registration, Anne felt <q>insignificant<\/q> and states, I <q>knew I would go down to my grave unwept, unhonored and unsung.<\/q> Anne honours the young <q>middy<\/q> by dropping her corsage offlowers on his grave. Montgomery, by reimagining her own university experiences in Anne\u2019s fictional ones, creates a novel that honours the experiences of the first-generations of women, working-class, and rural Canadian post-secondary students. Green spaces in this novel\u2014initially the Old Burying Ground, later the garden of their rented house, and then Point Pleasant Park\u2014are central to these young women\u2019s academic success, supporting their all-round physical, intellectual, and emotional well-being."

It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is represented by Bibliotheca and Biblioth\u0113k\u0113 (Greek: \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7): derivatives of these mean library in many modern languages, e.g. French biblioth\u00e8que."
