 * Right now, this is all fixture data. The purpose of this code is to separate
 * the rest of the app from the server (this is the only part of the code that
 * knows there's not actually a server)

 * Spec for story:
 *  id: a unique identifier (str)
 *  name: The name of the story (str)
 *  location: the lat,lng of the story (str) TODO update to numerical data
 *  description: text description of the story (array[str]. Each element is a
                 paragraph)
 *  images: a list of images associated with the story. The first image is the
            thumbnail/main image (array[image])
 *  audio:  a list of audio tracks associated with the story. array[audio]
 *
 
 *Spec for server: 

 * getStories(): resolves to a list of stories. The stories have ids, locations,
                and names - enough  info to display in a list without further
                requests.
 * storyInfo(id, attributes): resolves to an object with all of the properties
                              listed in attributes (a string array). The values
                              for these properties are copied from the story
                              matching id

                Halifax, Nova Scotia on the corner of Spring Garden Road \
                and Queen Street. It serves as the flagship library of the \
                Halifax Public Libraries, replacing the Spring Garden Road \
                Memorial Library.",

                administrators for several decades and approved by the \
                regional council in 2008. The architects, a joint venture \
                between local firm Fowler Bauld and Mitchell and Schmidt \
                Hammer Lassen of Denmark, were chosen in 2010 through an \
                international design competition. Construction began later \
                that year on a prominent downtown site that had been a \
                parking lot for half a century.",

                "The new library opened in December 2014 and has become a \
                highly popular gathering place. In addition to a book \
                collection significantly larger than that of the former \
                library, the new building houses a wide range of amenities \
                including cafés, an auditorium, and community rooms. The \
                striking architecture is characterised by the fifth floor's \
                cantilever over the entrance plaza, a central atrium \
                criss-crossed by staircases, and the building's \
                transparency and relationship to the urban context. The \
                library won a Lieutenant Governor’s Design Award in \
                Architecture for 2014."

                as the settlement, as the town's first burial ground. It \
                was originally non-denominational and for several decades \
                was the only burial place for all Haligonians. (The burial \
                ground was also used by St. Matthew's United Church \
                (Halifax).) In 1793 it was turned over to the Anglican \
                St. Paul's Church. The cemetery was closed in 1844 and \
                the Camp Hill Cemetery established for subsequent \
                burials. The site steadily declined until the 1980s when \
                it was restored and refurbished by the Old Burying \
                Ground Foundation, which now maintains the site and \

                headstones, some having been lost and many others being \

                Robert Ross, who led the successful Washington Raid of \

                the cemetery commemorating British victory in the \
                Crimean War. This is the second oldest war monument in \
                Canada and the only monument to the Crimean War in North \
                America. The arch was built in 1860, 16 years after the \
                cemetery had officially closed. The arch was built by \
                George Lang and is named after two Haligonians, Major \
                Augustus Frederick Welsford and Captain William Buck \
                Carthew Augustus Parker. Both Nova Scotians died in the \
                Battle of the Great Redan during the Siege of Sevastopol \
