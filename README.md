Chris G.'s notes one building for my mobile android device:
To run on your mobile device follow these instructions: http://www.neilberry.com/how-to-run-your-ionic-app-on-real-devices/
Had to make a licnese file though for android studio before I could build it (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40383323/cant-accept-license-agreement-android-sdk-platform-24) (I already had android studio installed from previously).
